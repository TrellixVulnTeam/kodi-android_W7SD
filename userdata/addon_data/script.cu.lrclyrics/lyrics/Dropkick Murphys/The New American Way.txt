Each day when I wake up and I set my best foot forward
I'll make an effort to be all that I can be
I take a look around me and I wonder how things change so much
In the few short years since I was a young boy

Do you know what we're fighting for?
I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward

Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way

The morals of this nation's youth have long gone astray
Led by tolerance, indifference and this kinder gentler way 
That has corrupted and destroyed so many of our boys and girls
Oh Lord, I start to wonder will it ever come around?

Do you know what we're fighting for?
I know in an instant I could lose everything I'm working toward

Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way

Yeah, I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
I know I'll win my battles though I fear we'll lose the war
To the new American way
